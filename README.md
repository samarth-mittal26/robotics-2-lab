Week One: Best Practices
Early robots all worked in factories, performing heavy and dangerous jobs such as welding and palletizing.

In the 1980s smaller robots emerged for use in assembly and packaging applications.

In the 2000s, robots were developed for non-factory applications such as surgery, and remote services.

By 2010 robots were being developed for either autonomous, or master-slave work in hazardous environments.

A cobot refers to a robot with the capability of being used in a collaborative operation. 

A collaborative workspace is a particular kind of operation in which an operator and a robot share the same workspace.

The safety pyramid has the 3 tools. 

1. Elimination, which refers to physically removing a hazard. 

2. Engineering controls, which incorporate programming, safety curtains, etc.  

3. Enterprise Controls, which changes the way an operator works through work instructions, restrictions, etc.

ISO 10218-1:2011 part 1 talks about the safety essentials for industrial robots.

ISO 10218-1:2011 part 2 incorporates the safety requirements at the integrator level.

ISO/ TS 15066-2016 builds upon the two previous standards and provides safety requirements for collaborative industrial robots.

The Robotics Industries Association (RIA) put together a technical report in 2016, the RIA TR R15.606-2016 which enhances the safety of personnel with collaborative industrial robot systems.

There are two central concepts in the technical report, which are collaborative robot systems design and requirements for applications

Control reliability is a concept and represents a function of relative safety.

A matrix provides a method to validate a robot or robotic system design.

There are three types of robot operations:

1. Coexistence

2. Cooperation

3. Collaboration.

ISO 13850 and ISO 13855 talk about emergency stop functions and positioning of safeguards w.r.t to the approach speed of a human body.

IEC 60204-1 includes general requirements for electrical equipment used in machinery.

There are two potential contacts that can occur between an operator and a robot. 

1. Quasi-static: when an operator’s body part can clamp between the moving part of the robot and another fixed or moving part of the robot system.

2. Transient contact: when the operator’s body part does not clamp, which means the operator can quickly retract or recoil from the moving part of the robot system.

A hazard is a condition capable of causing harm or an injury to an operator; or damage to the robotic system or environment.

A risk assessment is an evaluation of tasks and associated hazards on the basis of 

Injury severity

Exposure

Avoidance

1. An injury severity represents the degree of possible harm to an operator.

The consequences of the hazard range from S1 to S3. 

· S1 rating represents a low severe injury.

· S2 score represents moderate severity.

· S3 represents high seriousness.

2. An exposure, associated with frequency or duration, represents the likelihood of an operator being exposed to a hazard.

· E1 rating represents a low exposure to an occasional activity.

· E2 represents a high exposure to a routine or a continuous operation.

· E0 is an option for verification and validation of risk reduction measures.

3. Avoidance represents the ability of an operator to detect and avoid the potential failure mode or hazard. 

· A1 represents a possible avoidance where there is sufficient clearance to move out of the way and there is an adequate reaction time. 

· A2 represents insufficient clearance to run out of the way and reduced speed control is used. A2 rating doesn’t have adequate reaction time. 

· A3 represents an insufficient clearance to move out of the way and reduced control speed is not used. An A3 incident such as an explosion has almost null reaction time.

Week Two: Robots to Cobots
There are three broader classifications for why a robot safety incident can occur: 

1. A robotic arm or equipment causes an accident, putting an operator in a risky situation.

2. A mechanical part fails in the robot system. 

3. There could be an uncontrolled power supply to the robot.

List of identified root causes or source of hazards:

· Human interaction with a robot has the potential to cause dangerous or unpredicted movement or reaction by a robot. 

· Control errors are intrinsic or inherent faults/ bugs within the control system. These errors could also be in the software of the robot system. 

· Unauthorized access is when personnel are unfamiliar with the safeguards in place or their activation status. 

· Mechanical failure is conducive to an unexpected operation or end effector failure. Power systems pose serious fire risks caused by disruptive electrical signals. 

· Design of a collaborative robot cell is critical. If the design or the layout is inadequate, it can lead to inherent risks in the system. 

Week Three: Safety-Minded Design
There are three major factors that determine collision forces.  

1. The motor torque 

2. The kinetic energy of the robot and effective payload.  

3. The distance to decelerate 

Reflected inertia is the inertia of the motor and high speed part of the speed reducer multiplied by the square of the gear ratio seen at the output shaft of the speed reducer.  

The University of Mainz, in Germany developed several key measures for a machine that could apply both static and dynamic collision forces to various parts of the human body.

1. Clamping Force for static conditions

2. Impact Force for dynamic collisions

3. Pressure for the force per unit area

4. Compression Constant for the stiffness of different regions of the body

Week Four: Collaborative Workcells
The Robotic Workcell Design Toolkit consists of the following components: problem, process, critical path method (CPM), layout, simulation, and design alternatives. Each component is vital in order to effectively design a robotic workcell.

The challenges and key technologies in robotic cell design and optimization include: 

· Proper configuration selection for a given task

· Manual skill learning and translation

· Collaborative design tool

· Cell layout optimization and scheduling

· Tooling optimal design

· Human–robot collaboration

How to design a cobot cell in four steps:

1. Analyze and define the manual task map

2. Begin the robotic task map

3. Define the high-level task map

4. Design the layout (and update the task map)

An industrial robot is an automatically controlled, programmable, multi-purpose, manipulative machine with several degrees of freedom, for use in industrial automation applications. It may be either fixed in place or mobile.

Mobile robots are freely moving automatic programmable industrial robots.

Prosthetic robots are programmable manipulators or devices for missing human limbs.

Overall, week four primarily acts as a review of what was taught in the previous weeks.
